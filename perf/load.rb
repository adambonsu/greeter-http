  module Perf
    # Ruby-thread load generator for the deployed endpoint. VUS threads each
    # issue POST /greetings in a loop for DURATION_S, recording per-request
    # latency. The very first successful request (across all VUs) is captured
    # separately as the client-observed cold start and excluded from the
    # steady-state percentiles, so a Lambda cold start never skews the p95 gate.
    #
    # Each request targets a DISTINCT guest ("perf guest <vu>-<n>") so writes
    # spread across DynamoDB partitions, measuring real throughput rather than
    # single-item write contention. Hammering one guest would instead serialize
    # every VU on one counter item (the hot-partition case), where the
    # optimistic-lock transaction sheds load as 503s under heavy concurrency.
    #
    # The generator is RATE-PACED to the service's configured capacity (the
    # HttpApi stage throttles at RouteThrottleRate req/s). Each VU paces itself
    # to rate/vus req/s with think-time, so the aggregate stays at or just under
    # the rated limit. This measures latency under sustained rated load rather
    # than overrunning the throttle. An accidental overrun surfaces as HTTP 429,
    # which is accounted SEPARATELY as "throttled" (expected backpressure), not
    # as a hard failure — only 5xx, connection errors, and non-429 4xx fail.
    #
    # Only Ruby stdlib is used (net/http) — no k6 binary required. A k6 script
    # would be a drop-in alternative if preferred in CI.
